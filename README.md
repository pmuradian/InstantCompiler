Compiler for a small inperative language called "Instant"

--- directories ---
res directory contains jasmin.jar file to compile jasmin output
src directory contains haskell files generated by bnfc. InstantJVM.hs and InstantLLVM.hs files are for running jvm and llvm compilers respectively

--- compile and run ---
To run the program use Makefile command:
make - will create insc_jvm and insc_llvm executables in root directory
cleanall - will remove all created files after make command including executables insc_jvm and insc_llvm

Executing insc_jvm foo/bar/baz.ins for a correct program baz.ins will create files baz.j (Jasmin) and baz.class (JVM) in the directory foo/bar
Executing insc_llvm foo/bar/baz.ins for a correct program baz.ins should create files baz.ll (text LLVM) and baz.bc (lli-exectutable bitcode) in the directory foo/bar.
